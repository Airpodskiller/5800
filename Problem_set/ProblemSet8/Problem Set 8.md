Q1:
step  by  step  descent
(with  respect  to  the  objective  function)  along  edges  of  the  convex  polyhedral
set  from  one  vertex  to  an  adjacent one.

Q2: First,  the basis is usually  very  sparse. Second,  one  can  usually  rearrange  the  rows  and  columns  of
the  various  bases  encountered  in  the  course  of solution  so  that  they  are  nearly  triangular.

Q3： Figure out optimal  use  of  raw  material in bread production in order to maximize the profit.

Q4： Linear Programming

Q5： Application of the current software implementations of
the Simplex algorithm to real-life optimization problems are time
consuming when used as the bounding engine within an integer
linear programming framework. This paper aims to accelerate the
Simplex algorithm by proposing a novel parameterizable hard-
ware implementation of the algorithm on an FPGA.

Q6:  FIFO ：First In, First Out, known as FIFO, meaning data that first comes into a container would be popped out first.
